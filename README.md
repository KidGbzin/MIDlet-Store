### ‚ùì FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions):

#### There are already many sites and projects with the same goal. Why does this project exist?

I've been playing J2ME games since 2010‚Äîhonestly, I play more Java ME games than modern ones. Over the years, I used to download games from various websites, many of which have since shut down. Some game versions have become nearly impossible to find.

This project started as a personal backup of my favorite MIDlets, ensuring they remain organized and accessible without cluttering the downloads folder. But why keep it private? J2ME games‚Äîand the era they represent‚Äîdeserve to be remembered.

We‚Äôre not here to replace existing projects but to join forces with them, keeping the J2ME legacy alive for everyone. üöÄüéÆ

#### So you just download games from other sites and claim them as your own?

No, it's much more than simply downloading MIDlets from existing sites. Our process is meticulous because we aim for the highest quality possible.

Here‚Äôs what we do:

- **Version Curation:** We thoroughly search for and test multiple versions of each game, ensuring we find all possible variations and resolutions for the best gameplay experience.

- **Tagging & Organization:** Every game is carefully categorized with precise tags, making it easy to track, filter, and search for both games and MIDlets within the application.

- **Cleanup & Security:** We clean the MIDlet manifest and files, removing unnecessary or harmful elements, such as misleading names or potential malware. 

Additionally, we‚Äôre working on a way to credit the original sources where these games can still be found, acknowledging the amazing work that other sites and projects have done over the years. üíô
